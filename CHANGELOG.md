## 🔖 [1.1.0] — 2026-03-22

### 🔐 First-PIN-Sets-PIN + Smart NS Detection + DNS Parsing Hardening

---

#### First-PIN-Sets-PIN

- **The problem:** The default PIN (`123456`) is public knowledge — anyone who finds the dashboard URL can enter it. There was no friction to nudge users toward changing it.
- **The fix:** After a successful unlock with the *default* PIN, a second modal appears before the dashboard loads, asking the user to set a personal 6-digit PIN. The new PIN is entered once and confirmed — if they match, the PIN_HASH in memory updates immediately. The script then attempts an HTTP PUT to rewrite `index.html` on the server so the change persists across reloads. On static hosts where PUT is blocked, a dialog shows the new hash for manual copy/paste into the file.
- **Skip option:** Users who want to keep `123456` (e.g. public demos) can click "Skip for now" and proceed immediately.
- **The PIN hint** in the login overlay no longer shows `123456` — it just says "Enter PIN", so the default isn't advertised to visitors.

#### Smart NS Provider Detection

- **The problem:** All self-hosted nameservers were labelled `Own` — a vague catch-all. In practice there are meaningful distinctions:
  - `ns1.siteground.net` → SiteGround (very common, very specific)
  - `ns3.cloudflare.com` for `cloudflare.com` → the domain hosts its own NS (self-referential)
  - `a.ns.apple.com` for `apple.com` → same self-referential pattern
  - `ns1.amazon.com` for a third-party domain → `Own` (correct)
- **The fix:** A two-step detection algorithm replaces the flat `Own` fallback:
  1. **Named providers first** — AWS, Azure, Google, NS1, Akamai, Wikimedia, ClouDNS, DNSimple, and now **SiteGround** all have explicit pattern matches.
  2. **Apex domain comparison** — extract the last two DNS labels from each NS hostname and compare to the monitored domain's own apex. If all NS hostnames share their apex with the domain (e.g. `cloudflare.com` → `ns3.cloudflare.com`), label it **`Domain`** — meaning the domain operates its own nameserver infrastructure.
  3. **NS-in-domain check** — if an NS hostname contains the monitored domain's apex as a substring, extract and capitalise the domain name as the label (e.g. `ns1.paulfleury.com` would label as `Paulfleury`).
  4. **`Own` fallback** — only for genuinely unknown third-party registrar NS that don't match any of the above.
- **`detectNSProvider(nsRecords, domain)`** — the function now takes a second `domain` argument for the self-NS comparison. All call sites updated.
- **Two new helper functions added:**
  - `apexDomain(hostname)` — extracts the last two DNS labels (e.g. `sub.example.com` → `example.com`)
  - `capitalise(s)` — capitalises the first letter of a string

#### DNS Parsing Hardening

- **The problem:** Cloudflare DoH wraps all TXT record values in double-quotes: `"v=spf1 …"` and `"v=DMARC1; p=quarantine"`. While `.includes()` searches happened to work through the quotes in most cases, the regex match for SPF qualifier (`~all`, `-all`) could fail if the regex anchored at a quote character.
- **The fix:** All three parsing functions now strip leading and trailing double-quotes before analysis:
  - `parseSPF(txtRecords)` — strips `"` wrappers, then matches `v=spf1` and `[~\-+?]all`
  - `parseDMARCPolicy(txtRecords)` — strips `"` wrappers, then matches `v=dmarc1` and `p=reject/quarantine/none`
  - `detectMXProvider(mxRecords)` — strips the priority prefix (`"10 "`, `"20 "`) and trailing dot from MX data before provider matching
- **Additional MX providers added:** Fastmail, Apple iCloud (`icloud.com`, `apple.com`)
- **Null/empty guards added** to `detectNSProvider`, `detectMXProvider` — return `—` or `None` gracefully instead of throwing on empty arrays

### ✨ Added

- **`checkFirstUse()`** — called by `pinCheck()` after correct PIN; routes to Set-PIN modal if default PIN, otherwise straight to `initDashboard()`
- **`spDigit(d)`** — digit handler for the Set-PIN numpad (phase 1: new PIN, phase 2: confirm)
- **`spDelete()`** — backspace handler for Set-PIN numpad
- **`spConfirm()`** — validates PIN match, updates `PIN_HASH` in memory, calls `spPersistHash()`
- **`spSkip()`** — skips Set-PIN flow, calls `initDashboard()` directly
- **`spUpdateDots(errorRow?)`** — updates both rows of PIN dots; dims confirm row until new PIN is complete
- **`spPersistHash(newHash)`** — async; fetches `index.html`, replaces `PIN_HASH` line via regex, PUTs the file back; returns `true` on success
- **Set-PIN modal HTML** — two dot rows (new + confirm), full numpad, error message, skip link
- **`apexDomain(hostname)`** — DNS apex extraction helper
- **`capitalise(s)`** — string helper
- **`DEFAULT_PIN_HASH`** constant — SHA-256 of `123456`, used to detect first-use condition
- **SiteGround** explicit NS detection pattern
- **Fastmail**, **Apple iCloud** MX provider patterns
- **`detectNSProvider` second argument** `domain` — required for self-NS comparison

### 🔄 Changed

- `detectNSProvider(nsRecords)` → `detectNSProvider(nsRecords, domain)` — **breaking if called without domain arg**, but only called from `checkDomain()` which was updated
- `parseSPF()` — now strips `"` wrappers from TXT data before matching
- `parseDMARCPolicy()` — now strips `"` wrappers from TXT data before matching
- `detectMXProvider()` — strips `"priority "` prefix from MX data before matching
- PIN hint text changed from `"Demo PIN: 1 2 3 4 5 6 · keyboard works too"` to `"Enter PIN · keyboard works too"` — no longer advertises the default PIN to visitors
- `pinCheck()` now calls `checkFirstUse()` instead of `initDashboard()` directly

## 🎉 [1.0.0] — 2026-03-22

### ✨ Added (Initial Release)

- **Core feature:** Live DNS monitoring for any list of domains, running entirely in the browser
- **5-record DNS scan per domain:** A (uptime + latency), NS, MX, TXT (SPF), `_dmarc TXT`
- **Progressive batch scanning** — 5 domains/batch, 300ms pause between batches; rows light up as results arrive
- **Loading opacity states** — all rows dim to 40% while a scan runs, restore on completion
- **Rate limiting** — 10s minimum gap between full refreshes, 5s per-domain for row refresh
- **Per-row ↺ refresh** — re-scans a single domain with `fullScan=true` (NS/MX/DMARC/SPF included)
- **PIN gate** with SHA-256 hash — `onclick` attributes on numpad (no `addEventListener` / DOMContentLoaded issues)
- **Stateless SHA-256** — recomputes primes each call; no `sha256.h` / `sha256.k` caching bug
- **Dark / Light mode** toggle switch (CSS checkbox, no storage needed)
- **`domains.list`** loader — plain-text file, one domain per line, `#` comments, fallback to BUILTIN top-30
- **BUILTIN top-30** list — seeded with real scan data (NS, MX, DMARC, SSL expiry)
- **Add Domain modal** — type domain, pick category, queue multiple, confirm → immediate DNS check
- **Delete row button** — removes custom domains from the live list
- **Export CSV** — timestamped download
- **`domains.stats`** auto-write — PUT to server after every full scan
- **`update-stats.php`** — server-side cron script for SiteGround/cPanel (no chmod tricks)
- **`webhook.do`** — headless endpoint for cron-job.org and similar external schedulers
- **Hover tooltips** on NS, MX, DMARC, SPF columns showing raw records
- **Webhook modal** — cron setup instructions with Nginx/Apache config examples
- **Help/Info modal** — full feature explanation + GitHub link
- **Auto-refresh countdown** — 3-minute timer with progress bar
- **Search, sort (5 options), and filter** (Alerts only / Online only)
- **Responsive layout** — works on mobile and tablet
- **MIT License**
